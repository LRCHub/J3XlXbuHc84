霧の夢に眠る綿津見
器重ね軋む檻
割れて白く夢は紅
染めてわらべうたは途絶え消えた
Magic pages open wide, spilling secrets from
inside
Now the story stirs again, a tale that never
ends
Distant waves, they call to me
Echoing a memory
Melancholic and forlorn
Nostalgia reborn
刻々と壊されて
誰も読めない手紙
Now it is time to find myself
That frightened infant of the past
Trapped in a deathly hold, lost and cold
You're waiting for me
A ray of hope can lead the way
Let me sing for you every day
A melody unveiled, light prevails
Breaking through the void
Abyssal Hymn
時の虚ろ眠る我が罪
孤独わらべうたの律
抱いて
刻々と輪廻して
《Destiny and fate, laws of give and take》
偶然と必然の
《I'll return again, I'll see you again》
狭間を揺れる振り子
《Round and round, merry-go-round》
Now it is time to tell myself
You will never be alone
All sorrow disappears, no more fear
You're safe from the storm
A ray of light pierces the night
I will always be by your side
All voices raised in prayer, everywhere
Breaking through the dawn
Abyssal Hymn
霧の夢に眠る綿津見
Where past and future intertwine, the Ancient
sleeps
遙か古の未来で
Misty dreams hold a prophecy of truth
出会う
Someday soon
